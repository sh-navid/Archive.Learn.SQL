-- Keys

-- || 1 || Primary Key (PK) constraint: (https://byjus.com/gate/types-of-keys-in-dbms/)
-- || The primary key refers to a column or a set of columns of a table 
-- || that helps us identify all the records uniquely present in that 
-- || table. A table can consist of just one primary key. Also, this 
-- || primary key cannot consist of the same values repeating for any of 
-- || its rows.
-- || The PK (PRIMARY KEY) constraint that we put on a column/set of 
-- || columns wonâ€™t allow these to have a null value or a duplicate. 
-- || Any table can consist of only a single primary key constraint.

-- || 2 || Foreign Key: (https://byjus.com/gate/types-of-keys-in-dbms/)
-- || use a foreign key to establish relationships between two available tables.

-- || 3 || Unique Key: (https://byjus.com/gate/types-of-keys-in-dbms/)
-- || refers to a column/a set of columns that identify every record uniquely in 
-- || a table. All the values in this key would have to be unique. It is because 
-- || it is only capable of having one null value. A primary key, on the other 
-- || hand, cannot have a null value.
